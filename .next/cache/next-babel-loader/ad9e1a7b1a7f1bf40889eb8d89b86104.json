I have used this oil in the car every change. I change my oil every 5000 miles.This engine is wearing better than most of its kind. Fuel dilution is harmless at just a trace, and a TBN of 4.7 is good and strong.Try 7,000 miles for the next run.'\n  }],\n  items3: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'Good product and connects well. Highly recommended as a good product for a reasonable price. Bluetooth plays music on radio and connects for calls. Volume may be low for the other caller but they still hear clearly. Overall a product that offers value'\n  }],\n  items4: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'The device is perfect, has multi-functions with Bluetooth, aux in , multi charging usb ports.

I know everyone out there has their opinion on filters, personally I go with either K&N or Bosch with full synthetic oil since I can get away with 6,000 mile change intervals. The O ring for the filter housing cap fit perfectly and the filter was a snap to get it. I have no regrets or worries about having this under my hood.'\n  }],\n  items7: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'Love this type of oil filter! So much easier than crawling under the car to remove the filter and getting oil all over everything. On my Chevy Equinox you do need a 32mm socket to remove cap to get old filter out and you can get to it from the top of the engine'\n  }],\n  items8: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'I have a Nissan Frontier which takes 5 1/3 quarts of oil with a new filter change. So, I Was just a little short of the full mark and went to my local auto parts store to buy a quart. They wanted $10 for a quart! This was under $20 for 5 quarts. Can you say good buy? It’s oil, it’s Castrol and full synthetic.

I received this at my door (shipping, tax, etc.) for less than AED50! That is such a great deal. The filter fit fine, and included cap o-ring like every other brand has in this \"size\" (for my 2005 Saab 9-3). I am very pleased with this filter, and will continue to receive more with my subscription when I need them.'\n  }],\n  items10: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'It\"s perfect  As good as in the picture perfect size and quality  Excellent product and work perfectly and as advertised as well '\n  }],\n  items11: [{\n    id: 5,\n    avatar: '/images/avatars/avatar-3.jpg',\n    author: 'Helena Garcia',\n    date: 'December 12, 2020',\n    text: 'Great quality and looks very good.
