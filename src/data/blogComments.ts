Fuel dilution is harmless at just a trace, and a TBN of 4.7 is good and strong.Try 7,000 miles for the next run.',

I know everyone out there has their opinion on filters, personally I go with either K&N or Bosch with full synthetic oil since I can get away with 6,000 mile change intervals. The O ring for the filter housing cap fit perfectly and the filter was a snap to get it. I have no regrets or worries about having this under my hood.',
